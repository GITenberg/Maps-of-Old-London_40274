  <p>An atlas of Old London maps, showing the growth of the City throughout
  successive centuries, is now issued for the first time. Up to a recent
  date the maps here represented had not been reproduced in any form, and
  the originals were beyond the reach of all but the few. The London
  Topographical Society has done admirable work in hunting out and
  publishing most of them; but these reproductions are, as nearly as
  possible, facsimiles of the originals as regards size, as well as
  everything else. It is not every one who can afford to belong to the
  society, or who wishes to handle the maps in large sheets. In the present
  form they are brought within such handy compass that they will form a
  useful reference-book even to those who already own the large-scale ones,
  and, to the many who do not, they will be invaluable.</p>

  <p>The maps here given are the best examples of those extant, and are
  chosen as each being representative of a special period. All but one have
  appeared in the volumes of Sir Walter Besant's great and exhaustive
  "Survey of London," for which they were prepared, and the publishers
  believe that in offering them separately from the books in this handy
  form they are consulting the interests of a very large number of
  readers.</p>

  <p>The exception above noted is the map known as Faithorne's, showing
  London as it was before the Great Fire; this is added for purposes of
  comparison with that of Ogilby, which shows London rebuilt afterwards.
  Besides the maps properly so called, there are some smaller views of
  parts of London, all of which are included in the Survey.</p>

  <p>The atlas does not presume in any way to be exhaustive, but is
  representative of the different periods through which London passed, and
  shows most strikingly the development of the City.</p>

  <p>I must acknowledge the valuable assistance I have received from Mr.
  George Clinch, F.G.S., in the many difficulties which arose in the course
  of its preparation.</p>

<h5 class="lg125">PANORAMA OF LONDON</h5>

<h5><span class="sc">By</span> ANTONY VAN DEN WYNGAERDE</h5>

  <p><b>Description.</b>&mdash;This is the earliest representation of
  London that has come down to our time. Accurately speaking, it is not a
  map, but a picture; but as many of the old maps are more or less in the
  same category, we need not exclude it on that account. Such topographical
  drawings are apt to be misleading, owing to the immense difficulties of
  perspective&mdash;witness the wretched samples hawked about the pavements
  at the present time. But, considering the difficulties, this map of
  Wyngaerde's is wonderfully accurate, and it has the advantage of being
  full of architectural details which no true map could give.</p>

  <p><b>Designer.</b>&mdash;Of Wyngaerde himself little is known. He is
  supposed to have been a Fleming, and may have come to England in the
  train of Philip II. of Spain. He is known to have made other
  topographical drawings. The date of the one here reproduced cannot be
  fixed with perfect certainty, but must have been between 1543 and
  1550.</p>

  <p><b>Original.</b>&mdash;The original is in the Sutherland Collection at
  the Bodleian Library, Oxford, and it measures 10 feet by 17 inches, and
  is in seven sheets. A tracing of it, made by N. Whittock, can be seen in
  the Crace Collection, Prints Department, British Museum, or in the
  Guildhall Library.</p>

  <p>The present reproduction is from that made by the London Topographical
  Society, which photographed the original.</p>

  <p>It is reduced, and is here placed in three sections, which overlap for
  convenience in handling.</p>

<h5>I.</h5>

  <p><b>Details.</b>&mdash;If we examine the first section, which is that
  to the extreme west, we see the Abbey, very much as it is at present,
  with the exception of Wren's western towers. On the site of the present
  Houses of Parliament is the King's Palace at Westminster. It is
  impossible here to treat this in detail, for if that were attempted for
  all the buildings in this atlas, space would fail. A concise account of
  Westminster may be found in the book of that name in the <i>Fascination
  of London</i> Series. The chief point to note in the palace is St.
  Stephen's Chapel, of which the crypt now alone remains. About fifteen or
  twenty years previous to the date of this map King Henry VIII. had
  claimed Whitehall from Wolsey, and transferred himself to it from the old
  palace, which was growing ruinous.</p>

  <p>Across the river opposite to Westminster is Lambeth, standing in a
  grove of trees.</p>

  <p>Beyond Westminster westward all is open ground, in the midst of which
  we see St. James's Hospital, where is now St. James's Palace. Though
  still marked "Hospital," it had already been annexed by the King. Where
  is now Trafalgar Square we are shown in the map the King's Mews, built by
  Henry VIII. for his hawks. Charing Cross is marked by the cross put up in
  memory of Queen Eleanor. Along the river banks is a fringe of fine houses
  and foliage. We may pick out one or two of these princely
  buildings&mdash;namely, Durham House, Savoy Palace, and Somerset House
  (see <i>The Strand</i> in the above series). The church of St. Clement
  Danes is only separated from the open country by a single row of
  houses.</p>

  <p>On the west side of the Fleet River is Bridewell, built by Henry VIII.
  in 1522 for the entertainment of the Emperor Charles V. Here, in 1529,
  Henry and Katherine stayed while the legality of their marriage was being
  disputed in Blackfriars across the Fleet. Then we come to Old St. Paul's,
  still carrying its tall spire, destined so soon to topple down. Between
  it and the river is one of the most famous of the old strongholds,
  Baynard's Castle. On the extreme right of the map is the port of
  Queenhithe, which can be seen to-day by any wanderer in the City.</p>

<h5>II.</h5>

  <p>Turning the page, we see the old City as it was before the Fire, made
  up of gable-ended wooden houses with overhanging stories, crowded close
  together, and diversified by the numerous pinnacles and spires of the
  City churches, many of which were never rebuilt. The embattled line of
  the wall hems the City in on the north, and Cheapside cuts it laterally
  in a broad highway. Almost in the centre of the picture is the Guildhall.
  The interest reaches its culmination in the spectacle of Old London
  Bridge, with its irregular houses, its archways, and its chapel. Note
  that the engraver has not omitted to indicate the decaying heads on
  poles, a succession of which adorned the bridge throughout the centuries
  (see <i>The Thames</i> in above series).</p>

  <p>On the south side of the water is St. Mary Overies (see <i>Mediæval
  London</i>, vol. ii., p. 297). It has as neighbours Winchester and
  Rochester Houses, the residences of the respective Bishops of those sees;
  while the proud cupolas of Suffolk House&mdash;built <i>circa</i> 1516,
  and later used as the Mint&mdash;are clearly shown. The houses running
  from it up to the foreground of the picture are beautifully delineated,
  and may be taken as models of Elizabethan architecture; while the man
  with the harp and the horseman are quite clearly enough drawn to show
  their period by the style of their dress. From some point behind here
  must Wyngaerde have made his survey, as it is manifestly impossible it
  could have been done from Suffolk House, as stated by one authority.</p>

<h5>III.</h5>

  <p>There are three objects so striking in this picture that attention is
  at once claimed by them to the exclusion of all else&mdash;the Abbey of
  Bermondsey, the Tower of London, and Greenwich Palace. In Bermondsey two
  Queens died&mdash;Katherine, consort of Henry V., and Elizabeth, consort
  of Edward IV. Only a year or two before this map was made had the grand
  old Abbey been surrendered to the King (for a full account see
  <i>Mediæval London</i>, vol. ii., p. 288).</p>

  <p>The Tower, taken as a whole, is very much as we still know it; it is
  one of the oldest remaining relics of the past. Note the gruesome place
  of execution near by, and the guns and primitive cranes at work upon the
  wharf. Just beyond it eastward rise the fretted pinnacles of St.
  Katherine's by the Tower, on the spot now covered by St. Katherine's
  Docks.</p>

  <p>Stepney Church stands far away on the horizon, cut off from the City
  by an ocean of green fields.</p>

  <p>Returning to the south side, we see Says Court, Deptford, between
  Bermondsey and Greenwich. This was for long the home of John Evelyn, and
  was ruinously treated by Peter the Great, who tenanted it during his
  memorable stay in this country in 1698. (For Greenwich Palace or
  Placentia, see <i>London in the Time of the Tudors</i>.)</p>

<h5 class="lg125">CIVITAS LONDINUM</h5>

  <p><b>Description.</b>&mdash;This is the earliest map of London known to
  be in existence, for though Wyngaerde's survey preceded it in date, as we
  have seen, that is a panorama and not a map proper. The present map,
  which is known as that of Ralph Agas, itself has a good deal more of the
  panoramic nature than would be allowed in a modern one, and is on that
  account all the more interesting. The first to connect Agas's name with
  this map was Vertue (1648-1756), and he stated its date to be 1560; but,
  as will be seen in the description of the next plate, Vertue's claims to
  strict veracity have now been shaken, therefore his testimony must be
  accepted with caution.</p>

  <p><b>Designer.</b>&mdash;Ralph Agas, land surveyor and engraver, died in
  1621, and he is described in the register as "an aged." Of course, it is
  possible that Agas lived to the age of eighty-five or over, in which case
  he might not have been too young to execute this work in 1560, and he
  himself says, in a document dated 1606, which has been preserved, that he
  had been in work as a surveyor for upwards of forty years. There are two
  branches into which the enquiry now resolves itself. First, did Agas
  really make the map? And, second, if he did, at what date did he make it?
  There is no conclusive evidence on either hand. There is a survey of
  Oxford, similar in character, signed by him, and though this is not
  dated, it is known to have been completed in 1578, and published ten
  years later. On the original copy of this, which is at the Bodleian,
  there are the following lines:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Neare tenn yeares paste the author made a doubt</p>
      <p>Whether to print or lay this worke aside</p>
      <p>Untill he firste had London plotted out</p>
      <p>Which still he craves, although he be denied</p>
      <p>He thinkes the Citie now in hiest pride,</p>
      <p>And would make showe how it was beste beseene</p>
      <p>The thirtieth yeare of our moste noble queene."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><b>Original.</b>&mdash;The two earliest known copies of the Agas map,
  which was first engraved on wood, are both of the same issue; one is at
  the Pepysian Library, Magdalen College, Oxford, and the other at the
  Guildhall. Edward J. Francis made a careful reproduction of that at the
  Guildhall in 1874, and it is from that our present plate is taken. It is,
  of course, reduced, for the original is 6 feet and ½ inch long, by 2 feet
  4½ inches wide. The notes attached to this issue are by W. H. Overall,
  F.S.A., one of the leading authorities on the question. He doubts Agas's
  connection with the map, but thinks if he were the originator it could
  not have been done before 1591. The arms in the corner on the two oldest
  extant maps are those of James I., but as the arms on the royal barge in
  the river are those of Elizabeth, it has been conjectured that the maps
  are themselves copies of a later edition, wherein the arms were altered
  in conformity with conventional opinion. The chief points which give data
  from internal evidence are as follows: St. Paul's Cathedral is bereft of
  its spire. This was struck by lightning in 1561, so the map must be
  subsequent to that date. The Royal Exchange is apparently built. This was
  opened in 1570. Northumberland House, built about 1605, has not been
  begun. We may take it, therefore, generally that the original map, which
  was engraved on wooden blocks, was made some time in the latter half of
  Elizabeth's reign, and it is probable that it was done by Agas.</p>

  <p><b>Details.</b>&mdash;The map abounds in interesting detail.</p>

  <p>Beginning in the extreme left-hand lower corner, we see St. Margaret's
  Church, St. Stephen's Chapel, and Westminster Hall. In the river are
  swans of monstrous size. King Street, now merged in Whitehall, is very
  clearly shown, also the two heavy gates barring the way. The most
  northern of these, designed by Holbein, was called after him, and stood
  until the middle of the eighteenth century. North of it, on the west, is
  the tilting-ground; and stags browse in St. James's Park. Between the
  gates, on the east, are the Privy Gardens, overlooked by the Palace of
  Whitehall&mdash;most unpalatial in appearance.</p>

  <p>Piccadilly is "the Waye to Redinge," and Oxford Street "the Waye to
  Uxbridge." Near Whitcomb Lane and the Haymarket women are spreading
  clothes in the fields to dry, while cows as large as houses graze around.
  St. Martin's Lane leads up to St. Giles, more particularly dealt with in
  the description of the next plate. The irregular buildings of St. Mary
  Rouncevall, a religious house, had not yet been taken down to make way
  for Northumberland House, itself to be replaced by Northumberland Avenue.
  The houses of great nobles, with their magnificent gardens stretching
  down to the waterside, are still in evidence. North of the well-laid-out
  Covent Garden, owned by the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, are nothing
  but trees and fields. Passing on quickly down the Strand, we find Temple
  Bar blocking the way to the City. This is the old Temple Bar, replaced
  after the Great Fire by the one much more familiar to us, which stood
  until 1878. A very fine illustration of the old one is given in Sir
  Walter Besant's <i>London in the Time of the Tudors</i>, p. 245. This
  book should certainly be studied by anyone desirous of understanding the
  map. From Temple Bar past the back of St. Clement's Church runs a broad
  road roughly corresponding with our new Kingsway. Further eastward the
  Fleet River still flows strongly down from its northern heights, crossed
  by many bridges, and just where it joins the Thames is Bridewell Prison.
  Further along, on the other side, is Baynard's Castle, and in front of
  it, in the river, the Queen's barge, with the royal arms of Elizabeth in
  the centre. Some way back from Baynard's Castle a bridge crosses a
  street, and is marked "The Wardrop." This was in very truth the wardrobe
  or repository of the royal clothes! Drawing a line northward for some
  way, we come to Smithfield, where tilting is represented as in animated
  progress. Not far northward is St. John's, Clerkenwell, and its
  neighbouring nunnery; to the west is the Charterhouse. Turning south
  again, past St. Bartholomew's Church, we see the building of Christ's
  Hospital, founded by Edward VI. This, it may be noted, is one of the
  buildings erected since Wyngaerde's time. Then we come to St. Paul's,
  shorn of its spire, with St. Gregory's Church, quite recognizable, in
  front of it. There were continual edicts against building in the Tudor
  and Stuart reigns, for it was feared London would grow out of hand; but,
  in spite of this, houses have enormously increased since Wyngaerde made
  his survey. The battlemented wall still encloses the City, but hamlets
  have sprung up outside, notably at Cripplegate.</p>

  <p>But within the wall there are still some fine gardens and open spaces,
  one of which remains to this day in Finsbury Circus. Many roads meet in
  the heart of London, where now the Bank, Mansion House, and Royal
  Exchange stare across at each other. It is difficult to make out from the
  medley of buildings in the map if Gresham's first Royal Exchange is there
  or not, but it seems to be so. This was opened in 1570 by the Queen in
  person. St. Christopher le Stock's square tower may be seen on the ground
  now absorbed by the Bank of England.</p>

  <p>Crossing over now to the Surrey side, we see conspicuously the two
  round pens for bull- and bear-baiting respectively. There are many
  pleasure-gardens, for the Surrey side was for long the recreation-ground
  of the Londoner. On the river there are innumerable wherries, and below
  the bridge at Billingsgate many ships cluster; one has even managed to
  get above the bridge. Off the Steelyard and at the Tower are men and
  horses in the water. This is a most interesting point. In those at the
  Tower it may be clearly seen that the man is filling the water-casks on
  the animals' backs with a ladle. This gives a glimpse into the
  discomforts endured by our ancestors before water-pipes were laid on as a
  matter of course to all houses. In the eighteenth-century reproductions
  of this map, oddly enough, in one instance this detail has disappeared,
  and in the other it is turned into a man driving cows into the water with
  a whip; thus doing away with all its significance. Far to the north in
  Spitalfields men are practising archery; while Aldgate, for long the home
  of Geoffrey Chaucer, is conspicuous a little north of the Tower.</p>

  <p>As became a man living in days of the Reformation, Agas does not point
  out the religious houses then falling into decay or occupied by laymen,
  yet what a number of them must have been still in existence! Standing on
  the White Tower, and looking north and to the right hand, there must have
  been visible outside the wall St. Katherine's by the Tower, Eastminster,
  and the Sorores Minores, whose name still remains in the Minories, here
  marked. Within the City was Holy Trinity, close to Aldgate&mdash;of this
  a couple of most rare and interesting plans and a full account may be
  found in <i>Mediæval London</i>, vol. ii.&mdash;and not far off was St.
  Helen's Nunnery; also Crutched Friars, Austin Friars, Grey Friars, and,
  in the extreme west, near the Fleet, Blackfriars. Of these and many
  others full accounts may be found in the volume indicated above.</p>

<h5 class="lg125">THE PARISH OF ST. GILES IN THE FIELDS</h5>

  <p><b>Description.</b>&mdash;This plate, on being compared with the
  preceding one, shows a strong general resemblance, with a considerable
  difference in detail. Also, below are two churches, one of which is
  marked, "Present St. Giles's Church, built anno 1734," which shows that
  the map was made not earlier than that date. It is, in fact, a part of
  one of a set of eighteenth-century maps based on that of Agas, and not
  only differing from it in detail, but also differing slightly one from
  another. Some of these are unsigned, and some are signed "G. Vertue," and
  were specifically claimed by Vertue as having been made by him, and based
  upon Agas's map of 1560. Recently, however, doubts have been raised as to
  Vertue's share in the transaction, and it is now very commonly believed
  that he did no more than procure some maps, engraved on pewter and made
  in Holland, based on that of Agas. These he altered a little in detail,
  and then claimed as his own work. The original pewter plates are in
  possession of the Society of Antiquaries, Burlington House. The present
  example differs in some small particulars from these. Copies of the maps
  are not rare, and can be seen at the British Museum and elsewhere.</p>

  <p><b>Details.</b>&mdash;The bit of London here represented is of
  exceptional interest. It shows the corner of Tottenham Court Road when
  High Street and Broad Street, St. Giles, were the main highway, long
  before the cutting through of New Oxford Street. It shows, further, the
  descent of Holborn into the valley of the Fleet, the "heavy hill" along
  which criminals were brought from Newgate to the place of execution. It
  shows the site where the gallows stood for some time, about 1413, before
  being definitely set up at Tyburn. Close to this was the Bowl tavern,
  where the condemned man was allowed his last draft of ale. The most
  interesting old hospital for lepers is clearly shown. (See "Holborn,"
  <i>Fascination of London</i> Series.)</p>

<h5 class="lg125">"LONDINUM FERACISSIMI ANGLIÆ REGNI METROPOLIS"</h5>

<h5><span class="sc">By</span> HOEFNAGEL</h5>

  <p><b>Description.</b>&mdash;This map seems at first sight to be much
  less interesting than those which have preceded it, but that is due
  chiefly to its small size. The probable date is 1572, and even if
  otherwise unknown, it might have been judged approximately by the
  costumes of the figures in the foreground. It must have been contemporary
  with, or even earlier than, Agas, with whose work it is interesting to
  compare it. This map was made by Hoefnagel, and is taken from Braun and
  Hogenburg's work, <i>Civitates Orbis Terrarum</i>, in which Braun wrote
  the text, while Hogenburg and Hoefnagel engraved the maps. In the
  left-hand top corner are the arms of Elizabeth, and in the right-hand
  corner those of the City. In the later editions the delicately drawn
  figures in the foreground are omitted. In his notes on Old London Maps in
  the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries, vol. vi., Mr. W. H.
  Overall says it cannot be supposed that all the cities of the world
  engraved in Braun and Hogenburg's work were freshly surveyed for the
  purpose; and there are several points&mdash;such, for instance, as the
  inclusion of the steeple of St. Paul's, destroyed in 1561&mdash;which
  point to the fact that this version was probably taken from existing
  surveys. The original is 19 inches by 12¾ inches. The bull- and
  bear-baiting pits on the Surrey side are quite conspicuous, and so is the
  royal barge, in very much the same position in the river as it is in
  Agas's map. Here is a detailed account of it in Sir Walter Besant's own
  words:</p>

  <p><b>Details.</b>&mdash;"This is in some respects more exact than the
  better-known map attributed to Agas. The streets, gardens, and fields are
  laid down with greater precision, and there is no serious attempt to
  combine, as Agas does, a picture or a panorama with a map. At the same
  time, the surveyor has been unable to resist the fashion of his time to
  consider the map as laid down from a bird's-eye view, so that he thinks
  it necessary to give something of elevation.</p>

  <p>"I will take that part of the map which lies outside the walls. The
  precinct of St. Katherine stands beside the Tower, with its chapel,
  court, and gardens; there are a few houses near it, apparently
  farmhouses. The convent of Eastminster had entirely vanished. Nothing
  indicates the site of the nunnery in the Minories, yet there were ruins
  of these buildings standing here till the end of the eighteenth century.
  Outside Bishopsgate houses extended past St. Mary's Spital, some of whose
  buildings were still apparently standing. On the west side St. Mary of
  Bethlehem stood, exactly on the site of Liverpool Street Station, but not
  covering nearly so large an area; it appears to have occupied a single
  court, and was probably what we should now consider a very pretty little
  cottage, like St. Edmund's Hall, Oxford.</p>

  <p>"Outside Cripplegate the houses begin again, leaving between the Lower
  Moorfields dotted with ponds; there are houses lining the road outside
  Aldersgate. The courts are still standing of St. Bartholomew's Priory,
  Charterhouse, St. John's Priory, and the Clerkenwell nunnery; Smithfield
  is surrounded with houses; Bridewell, with its two square courts, stands
  upon the river bank; Fleet Street is irregular in shape, the houses being
  nowhere in line; the courts of Whitefriars are still remaining. The
  Strand has all its great houses facing the river; their backs open upon a
  broad street, with a line of mean houses on the north side. On the south
  of the river there is a line of houses on the High Street, a line of
  houses along the river bank on either side, and another one running near
  Bermondsey Abbey.</p>

  <p>"Within the walls we observe that some of the religious houses have
  quite disappeared&mdash;Crutched Friars, for instance. There is a vacant
  space, which is probably one of the courts of St. Helen's. The Priory of
  the Holy Trinity preserves its courts, but there is no sign of the
  church. There are still visible the courts and gardens of Austin Friars.
  There is still the great court of the Grey Friars, but the buildings of
  Blackfriars seem to have vanished entirely" (<i>London in the Time of the
  Tudors</i>, p. 185).</p>

<h5 class="lg125">NORDEN'S MAPS OF LONDON AND WESTMINSTER</h5>

  <p><b>Designer.</b>&mdash;Being on a very small scale, these maps are not
  so attractive as some that have been already discussed. John Norden, the
  designer, was born about 1548, and seems to have had from the first an
  extraordinary gift of delicate penmanship, which he turned to much
  account in map-making. He projected a whole "Speculum Britanniæ," but
  during his lifetime only managed to publish books on two
  counties&mdash;namely, Middlesex and Hertfordshire. He left behind him
  the results of his labours on many other counties in manuscript, and
  these have since been published. Norden was appointed Surveyor of His
  Majesty's Woods in 1609. The engraving of the Middlesex maps was done by
  Peter Van den Keere.</p>

  <p><b>Originals.</b>&mdash;The reproductions are taken from those which
  appear in Norden's <i>Middlesex</i>, dated 1593. Each map is 9½ inches by
  6¾ inches. The wonderful delicacy of Norden's work makes these maps
  peculiarly appreciated by students of London cartography.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

  <p><a name="textVII"></a></p>

<h5 class="lg125">FAITHORNE AND NEWCOURT</h5>

  <p><b>Description.</b>&mdash;This map generally goes by the name of
  Faithorne, the engraver, but in reality the credit is due quite as much
  to Richard Newcourt the elder (d. 1679), who was the draughtsman. It is
  selected for a place here because, the date being 1658, it shows the City
  as it was before the Fire, and therefore forms a supplement to the map of
  Ogilby which follows, and shows the City as it was when rebuilt after the
  Fire.</p>

  <p><b>Engraver.</b>&mdash;William Faithorne the elder was born in 1616,
  and was an engraver and portrait painter. He engraved numerous portraits,
  book-plates, maps, and title-pages. Among his works are two large maps,
  entitled "Cities of London and Westminster," and of "Virginia and
  Maryland."</p>

  <p><b>Original.</b>&mdash;The only two copies of the original issue known
  to be extant are in the Print Rooms, British Museum, and in the
  Bibliothèque Nationale of Paris. The map here given is taken from a sheet
  of that in the British Museum, and is on the same scale.</p>

  <p><b>Details.</b>&mdash;It will be noticed that the sheet chosen for
  inclusion in this atlas shows very nearly the same area as the map of
  Ogilby which follows, but does not go quite so far eastward as the Tower.
  The City wall is clearly shown along the north side of the City, and the
  bastion near Cripplegate stands out; the town ditch can be traced just
  beyond this corner running southward. It was the curious and apparently
  meaningless angle that the wall makes here which led Sir Walter Besant to
  suggest that it may have been designed to exclude the ancient Roman
  amphitheatre, of which the site is now lost (see <i>Early London</i>, p.
  85). The Fleet River is shown still open and crossed by bridges, of which
  there are no fewer than five from Holborn to the mouth. That at Fleet
  Street shows, indeed, a continuous line of houses. St. Paul's is very
  clearly delineated. The figures within the City refer to the old
  churches, of which a list is given below. Notice the gable roofs, still
  the chief style of domestic architecture. The lines of the streets in the
  heart of the City remain wonderfully the same to our own day. Outside the
  walls the City is stretching out great arms into the country. There is
  one such arm made by the continuous houses fringing Bishopsgate Street as
  far as the extreme northern limit of the map. Then there is a gap between
  this and Moorgate Street, including all the ground known at Moorfields
  and Finsbury. A few scattered houses and some cultivated fields cover
  this space, and in one corner is "Bedlame."</p>

  <p>A mass of houses lies westward, running on to the Charter House,
  northward of which are open fields, and so to "Clarkin Well."</p>

<h5 class="lg125">OGILBY'S MAP OF LONDON</h5>

  <p><b>Description.</b>&mdash;This is more exclusively a plan of the City
  than any we have yet considered. It runs roughly from the Tower to
  Lincoln's Inn Fields, and the reason why it is thus limited is that it
  was made as a survey to assist in the plotting out of land in the City
  after the Fire.</p>

  <p><b>Designer.</b>&mdash;John Ogilby was born about 1600, and did not
  turn his attention to surveying until he was about sixty-six, when he
  secured the appointment as "King's Cosmographer and Geographical
  Printer." He died in 1676, the year before his map was published. He was
  assisted in the work by William Morgan, his wife's grandson, and most of
  the actual engraving of the map was done by Hollar.</p>

  <p><b>Original.</b>&mdash;The original is 8 feet 5 inches by 4 feet 7
  inches, and is in twenty sheets. It is on the scale of 100 feet to the
  inch. It may be seen in the British Museum (Crace Collection) and in the
  Guildhall. The two examples differ a little, and that in the Guildhall
  has an additional sheet. The reproduction here given is taken from that
  made by the London and Middlesex Archæological Society from the British
  Museum copy. The arms of the City are in the left-hand top corner, and
  those of Sir Thomas Davies, Lord Mayor 1676-77, in the right-hand
  corner.</p>

  <p><b>Details.</b>&mdash;Beginning at the left-hand top corner, we find
  pastures, bowling-greens, and market-gardens. Aylesbury House, next to
  St. John Street, has magnificent private gardens, and beyond the
  Charterhouse bowling-green there is a wood. Further east the Honourable
  Artillery Company, which had been revived by Cromwell, can be seen, with
  their equipment and tents. This company is directly descended from the
  Finsbury Archers, whom we noted in the last map, and it is interesting to
  know that the actual ground on which they are here depicted is still
  reserved for their use. Moorfields is neatly laid out and planned, and
  south of it is new Bethlehem Hospital, now transferred across the river.
  Eastward, again, there is a large open space at Devonshire House Garden,
  and southward innumerable gardens can be seen, some of which are
  preserved to this day behind City halls, etc., but so hidden that no one
  who did not know of their existence could possibly find them.</p>

  <p>On tracing the line of the City wall on the north side we see how some
  of the churches, notably St. Giles's and St. Botolph's, have taken a part
  of the town ditch for the enlargement of their churchyards; near St.
  Bartholomew's the town ditch is still marked. This ditch caused the Mayor
  and Council as much worry as the increase of houses, because it was the
  receptacle for every kind of filth, and its cleansing annually swallowed
  up a large sum of money. The Fleet River is shown flowing down in the
  open, and is called the New Canal. It is crossed by a bridge at Holborn
  and another at Fleet Street. We can mark the sinuous line of the great
  thoroughfare of Holborn as it was before the viaduct and approaches were
  made. The Strand outside Temple Bar shows the obstructions which have
  only finally been removed in our own time. Butcher Row disappeared first
  in 1813; other streets followed to make way for the new Law Courts, and
  with the destruction of Holywell Row and the opening of Kingsway the
  improvements here may be considered complete.</p>

  <p>To the south are the great houses of Essex and Arundel, with their
  gardens; their names are preserved in the streets that flow over their
  sites. Somerset House, the Protector's palace, was then standing, and did
  not make way for its present representative for another hundred years.
  The river is covered with wherries, clustered as thickly as ants. It is
  still the main highway for most people, though there were hackney coaches
  for hire. There was still only London Bridge by which to get across the
  river on foot, and the boats were used as ferries. There were tilt-boats,
  too, as well as the smaller wherries; these ran at stated intervals, like
  our own omnibuses, and were protected by an awning. Near the Fleet mouth
  is Bridewell, once a palace, and the scene of the meeting of Parliament,
  but given by Edward VI. to be a prison. On the east is a blank space,
  where is now the station of the London Chatham and Dover Railway Co., who
  purchased it in 1844. The site of St. Paul's was plotted out, but not yet
  built upon. In fact, the rebuilding of the houses was the first
  consideration, and was done with remarkable promptness, for in the
  meantime the poor houseless wretches were camping on Moorfields. The
  churches and city halls were therefore left to the last; yet even so we
  may see that, though only eleven years had elapsed since the destruction
  of the City, about twenty churches had been rebuilt out of the
  eighty-seven that were destroyed. The picturesque Old London of the
  gable-ends and overhanging stories was gone, never to return; but gone
  also was a great deal of rubbish and an insanitariness never afterwards
  quite so bad. As for the overcrowding, we must see what Sir Walter Besant
  says:</p>

  <p>"If we look into Ogilby's map, we see plainly that as regards the
  streets and courts London after the Fire was very much the same as London
  before the Fire; there were the same narrow streets, the same crowded
  alleys, the same courts and yards. Take, for instance, the small area
  lying between Bread Street Hill on the west and Garlick Hill on the east,
  between Trinity Lane on the north and Thames Street on the south: is it
  possible to crowd more courts and alleys into this area? Can we believe
  that after the Fire London was relieved of its narrow courts with this
  map before us? Look at the closely-shut-in places marked on the
  maps&mdash;'1 g., m. 46, m. 47, m. 48, m. 40.' These are respectively
  Jack Alley, Newman's Rents, Sugar-Loaf Court, Three Cranes Court, and
  Cowden's Rents. Some of these courts survive to this day. They were
  formed, as the demand for land grew, by running narrow lanes between the
  backs of houses and swallowing up the gardens. There were 479 such courts
  in Ogilby's London of 1677, 472 alleys, and 172 yards, besides 128 inns,
  each of which, with its open courts for the standing of vehicles and its
  galleries, stood retired from the street on a spot which had once been
  the fair garden of a citizen's house" (<i>London in the Time of the
  Stuarts</i>, p. 280).</p>

<h5 class="lg125">LONDON IN 1741-45</h5>

<h5><span class="sc">By JOHN ROCQUE</span></h5>

  <p><b>Description.</b>&mdash;In some ways this map is the most
  interesting of the whole series, for it comes nearest to our own times,
  and yet by studying it we can infer the remarkable changes that have
  taken place within the memory of man. It is much more comprehensive than
  Ogilby's, including the whole of the outlying suburbs, and even going as
  far as Edgware and Tottenham, which are still no part even of Greater
  London.</p>

  <p><b>Designer.</b>&mdash;Very little is known about John Rocque. He was
  probably a native of France, but was residing in England about 1750. He
  engraved maps and a few views from his own designs.</p>

  <p><b>Original.</b>&mdash;The original is in twenty-four sheets, and is
  13 feet in length and 6¾ feet in depth. It can be seen at the British
  Museum. That which is here presented is the central part of this, not
  reduced, but on the same scale. Its interest is greatly increased by the
  fact that the names are printed on the map, and are not given separately
  as in other instances. To facilitate this Rocque has marked the houses
  bordering streets in white, and only blocked them in black where they
  line market-gardens and other parts indicated by a light surface. The map
  is a model of care and comprehensive detail.</p>

  <p><b>Detail.</b>&mdash;Beginning in the lower left-hand corner, we have
  the Royal Hospital, with its neatly-laid-out grounds. Close to it the
  Westbourne, whose irregular line determined the boundaries of Chelsea,
  falls into the Thames; higher up its course is through the Five Fields,
  now one of the most wealthy and popular districts of London&mdash;namely,
  Belgravia. St. George's Hospital is already standing at Hyde Park Corner,
  and a fringe of houses lines the road to Knightsbridge. Westminster is
  still largely open in the west by Tothill Fields, scene of so many
  tournaments and jousts, and the curve of the river encloses innumerable
  market-gardens. In St. James's Park the stiff canal, memento of Dutch
  influence, has not yet been transformed into the more attractive
  ornamental water. Carlton House Terrace has not come into existence. Here
  Carlton House, which does not appear to be marked, was standing, and was
  occupied by Frederick, Prince of Wales, father of George III. North of
  this, with the omission of Regent Street, made in 1813-20, the streets
  are pretty much as we know them. It is beyond Oxford Street northward
  that the difference is striking. This district was only just being built
  upon, and the well-laid-out streets soon run off into open country.
  "Marybone" Gardens, a favourite tea-garden, and the church, and a few
  houses, form a little hamlet just connected with the other part of London
  by a single street, and further westward, north of Berkeley Square, are
  fields. In the midst of these is the "Yorkshire Stingo," the public-house
  from which the first omnibus in the Metropolis began to run in 1829. The
  Tyburn Gallows still had much work to do; it was fifty years later that
  the last execution took place here. Just within the Hyde Park is the
  gruesome record, "where soldiers are shot." If we follow Oxford Street
  eastward to Tottenham Court Road, we find that it is only connected with
  High Holborn by the curve through High and Broad Streets at St. Giles's.
  To the south is the star of Seven Dials, and all the district so
  completely altered by the cutting through of Charing Cross Road, and then
  Shaftesbury Avenue in modern times. To the north, Montagu House occupies
  the site the British Museum was destined to fill; it was purchased by the
  Government in 1753, and pulled down about a hundred years later. Bedford
  House, the town residence of the Dukes of Bedford, stood until 1800.
  Behind, Lamb's Conduit Fields run up to Battle Bridge, where one of the
  early British battles was fought; this is now the site of King's Cross
  Station. Not far off Bagnigge Wells and Sadler's Wells are in the heyday
  of their prosperity. The Fleet or River of Wells may be traced passing
  through the former, but further south it is covered in, and does not
  appear in the open again until below Fleet Bridge, when it is
  ignominiously called Fleet Ditch.</p>

  <p>Thames side is still fringed with "stairs to take water at" leading
  from the great houses on the margin, and there is as yet no embankment.
  Westminster and Blackfriars Bridges, however, afford easy access to the
  southern side. The labyrinth of the City is not seriously different from
  that of the present day except in the omission of Cannon Street.
  Bethlehem Hospital is still conspicuous, and the City wall has vanished
  strangely. What we now call Finsbury Square is marked as Upper
  Moorfields. We have to go far before we clear the houses to the east.
  Stepney and Bethnal Green are fairly thickly populated, and though
  surrounded by open ground, are connected by houses all the way from the
  City. But in the bend of the river by Wapping the chief area is occupied
  by market-gardens. Crossing over to the other side, we find the
  market-gardens very prominent; as London grows larger she thrusts her
  sources of supply further from her. The central ganglion of the Borough
  Road and its ray-like connections are marked out. At one end is the
  "King's Bench," which was close to the Marshalsea, associated with
  "Little Dorrit." The Marshalsea itself is not marked. Dickens was yet to
  come, and it was only through his writings that it gained a sentimental
  interest. A great part of the Borough is very marshy indeed, and we note
  frequent ponds. The "Dog and Duck," otherwise "St. George's Spaw," is
  almost surrounded by them.</p>

  <p>To sum up in Sir Walter Besant's words:</p>

  <p>"London, then, in the eighteenth century consisted first of the City,
  nearly the whole of which had been rebuilt after the Fire, only a small
  portion in the east and north containing the older buildings; a workmen's
  quarter at Whitechapel; a lawyer's quarter from Gray's Inn to the Temple,
  both inclusive; a quarter north of the Strand occupied by coffee-houses,
  taverns, theatres, a great market, and the people belonging to these
  places; an aristocratic quarter lying east of Hyde Park; and Westminster,
  with its Houses of Parliament, its Abbey, and the worst slums in the
  whole City. On the other side of the river, between London Bridge and St.
  George's, was a busy High Street with streets to right and left; the
  river bank was lined with houses from Paris Gardens to Rotherhithe; there
  were streets at the back of St. Thomas's and Guy's; Lambeth Marsh lay in
  open fields, and gardens intersected by sluggish streams and ditches; and
  Rotherhithe Marsh lay equally open in meadows and gardens, with ponds and
  ditches in the east....</p>

  <p>"From any part of London it was possible to get into the country in a
  quarter of an hour. One realizes the rural surroundings of the City by
  considering that north of Gray's Inn was open country with fields; that
  Queen Square, Bloomsbury, had its north side left purposely open in order
  that the residents might enjoy the view of the Highgate and Hampstead
  Hills. On the south side of the river Camberwell was a leafy grove; Herne
  Hill was a park set with stately trees; Denmark Hill was a wooded wild;
  the hanging woods of Penge and Norwood were as lovely as those that one
  can now see at Cliveden or on the banks of the Wye" (<i>London in the
  Eighteenth Century</i>, pp. 77-79).</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
